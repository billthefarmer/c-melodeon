                              Melodeon
                              ========

One row melodeon emulator with bass. Uses the standard PC keyboard
function keys F1-F12 as melodeon buttons, the Control and Alt keys as
bass buttons, and the space bar as the bellows. Unfortunately,
depending on your luck, the keyboard on your PC may not detect more
than two or three buttons pressed at once. I found an old keyboard
worked much better. You can see what is going on in the bottom half of
the melodeon window, which shows what keys the program thinks are
pressed.

Dependancies
============

Melodeon uses ALSA, FluidSynth, and Gtk+, so you need libasound2,
libfluidsynth1, and libgtk2.0-0. If you are running a Debian-like
system, like Ubuntu, you can get these with the shell command 'sudo
apt-get install libasound2 libfluidsynth1 libgtk2.0-0'. That should
take care of any further dependancies. Fluidsynth also needs a
soundfont file. I have included 8MBGMSFX.SF2, which is available from
the ALSA wiki: http://alsa.opensrc.org/8MBGMSFX.SF2.

Controls
========

There are three drop down controls, a check box, a volume control, and
a button in the top half of the window. The instruments drop down lets
you choose what midi instrument you would like to attempt to play. The
reverse button check box lets you play widdershins. The key drop down
lets you choose a key to play in. There is a choice of Eb, Bb, F, C,
G, D, A. The key defaults to C. More kays can be added by popular
request, or you can hack the program yourself. The layout drop down
lets you choose a layout. The volume control lets you change the
volume. The volume defaults to maximum. The quit button lets you give
up, or you can click on the window close icon. The key may be changed
by pressing the letter key corresponding to the desired playing
key. The buttons may be reversed by pressing the 'R' key.

Playing
=======

Hold the PC keyboard in a vertical position, so the function keys are
on the side you want to play the melody on. Adjust the reverse check
box according to which hand you want to use. Press the keys as if they
were melodeon buttons, and press the space bar to emulate waggling the
bellows. If you don't know how to play melodeon see

Building
========

You have a choice: If you have a Debian/Ubuntu system, you should be
able to just type 'make'. The dependancies are: libasound2-dev and
libgtk2.0-dev, so if you haven't got them installed, you can type
'sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libgtk2.0-dev'. This will install
loads of other stuff as well. If you want the full monty with error
messages buried in pages of gnubabble, or your system is completely
different, type './configure', 'make' and 'make install' if
successful. See INSTALL for the official instructions. This will
overwrite the nice simple Makefile, but there is a cunning backup in
Makefile.de. Obviously autoconf doesn't understand German.
