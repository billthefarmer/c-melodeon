                              Melodeon
                              ========

Simple one row melodeon emulator with no bass. Uses the standard PC
keyboard function keys F1 - F12 as melodeon buttons, and the space bar
as the bellows direction. Unfortunately, depending on your luck, the
keyboard on your PC may not detect more than two or three buttons
pressed at once. You can see what is going on in the bottom half of
the melodeon window, which shows what keys the program thinks are
pressed.

Controls
========

There are two drop down controls, a check box, a slider, and a button
in the top half of the window. The instruments drop down lets you
choose what midi instrument you would like to attempt to play. The
reverse buttons check box lets you play widdershins. The key drop down
lets you choose a key to play in. There is a choice of Eb, Bb, F, C,
G, D, A. The key defaults to C. More kays can be added by popular
request or you can hack the program yourself. The volume slider lets
you change the volume. The volume defaults to maximum. The quit button
lets you give up, or you can click on the window close icon.

Playing
=======

Hold the PC keyboard in a vertical position, so the function keys are
on the side you want to play the melody on. Adjust the reverse check
box according to which hand you want to use. Press the keys as if they
were melodeon buttons, and press the space bar to emulate waggling the
bellows.

Building
========

Use the makefile with Mingw or Cygwin GCC, or use a Microsoft C
compiler to build. There are no resources, as the Mingw tools don't
appear to suppost them. The manifest can be built into the application
using Microsolt tools. The manifest file enables the use of new style
tools, but the application works fine without.
