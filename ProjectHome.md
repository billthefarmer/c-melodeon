# Melodeon #
Melodeon/accordion emulation written in C. Uses PC keyboard function keys and space bar to emulate a one row melodeon with bass. There is a choice of midi instruments, keys and button layout. Windows, [Linux](http://code.google.com/p/melodeon/wiki/Linux) and [Mac](http://code.google.com/p/melodeon/wiki/Mac) versions have been released. The bass works on the linux version, but using it can cause strange things to happen, see [Linux](http://code.google.com/p/melodeon/wiki/Linux) and the README. Version 1.06 fixes a bug in the combo drop-down boxes in Vista and Windows 7.

## Playing ##
Hold the keyboard facing away from you with the Esc button at the bottom and the Pause button under your chin. Play the function keys, waggling the space bar as it were the bellows. If you are really good you can play bass simultaneously on the Control and Alt keys. The key may be changed by pressing the letter key for the desired playing key. The buttons may be reversed by pressing the 'R' key. If you don't know how to play button accordion / melodeon, see http://info.melodeon.net.
